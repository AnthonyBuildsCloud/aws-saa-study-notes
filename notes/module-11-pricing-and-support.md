# Module 11 — Pricing and Support (AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials)

## What this module covered (high-level)
- AWS pricing fundamentals and cost drivers
- AWS pricing and billing tools
- AWS Support plans and use cases
- Cost optimization strategies in real-world scenarios

## 5 key takeaways
1) **AWS uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model**  
   You pay only for the resources you consume (compute time, storage, requests, data transfer), enabling flexibility but requiring cost awareness.

2) **Cost visibility is built into AWS**  
   Tools like Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, and Cost & Usage Reports help monitor, forecast, and control spending.

3) **Pricing models can significantly reduce costs**  
   Savings Plans and Reserved Instances offer discounts for predictable workloads compared to On-Demand pricing.

4) **Support plans scale with workload criticality**  
   Basic is free, Developer supports non-production workloads, Business supports production systems, and Enterprise supports mission-critical operations.

5) **Cost optimization is an ongoing responsibility**  
   Architects must right-size resources, choose managed services wisely, and continuously evaluate costs using AWS tools.

## Service selection cheat-sheet (when to use what)
- **AWS Pricing Calculator** → estimate costs before deploying workloads
- **AWS Cost Explorer** → analyze historical and current AWS spend
- **AWS Budgets** → set alerts for cost or usage thresholds
- **Cost & Usage Report (CUR)** → detailed, line-item billing data
- **Savings Plans** → flexible discounts for consistent compute usage
- **Reserved Instances (RIs)** → long-term discounts for steady workloads
- **AWS Support Plans** → Basic, Developer, Business, Enterprise
- **AWS Marketplace** → pre-built solutions with AWS-integrated billing

## Things I’m fuzzy on (review list)
- Differences between **Savings Plans vs Reserved Instances**
- When **data transfer costs** apply (cross-AZ vs cross-region)
- Which **AWS Support plan** is appropriate for different business sizes
- Practical use cases for **Cost & Usage Reports** vs Cost Explorer

3) If I need 24/7 production support with fast response times, I need: _____ because _____.
